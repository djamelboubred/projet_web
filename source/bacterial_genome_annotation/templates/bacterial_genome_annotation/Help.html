		<div class="sectionTitle">LADN</div>
		<div class="helpContent">LADN is a website project designed to let users add, modify and annotate genomes or sequences depending on their permissions. Another goal of this website is to be able to blast a sequence against our database.

		<div class="sectionTitle">How it works</div>

			<div class="helpContent">
				When you access our website, you first land on our search page, because most of the actions that a random user would need usually require a sequence or a genome. You can notice a sidebar on the left side of the screen, which displays different menus: 
				<ul>
					<li>The "Features" menu</li>
					<li>The "Connexion" menu</li>
					<li>The "About us" menu</li>
					<li>The "Help" menu</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				The "Features" menu displays all the possible actions for a user, but clicking on some actions such as "Annotate" requires to be logged in and to have the permissions to access the page (you have to at least be an annotator). The connexion menu displays two options if you are not logged: "Sign in" and "Sign up". If you are logged in, it gives you the possibility to either log out or access your account information.
				The "About us" menu gives you the possibility to either contact us if you have a message for us (weather it's a bug or a suggestion, we'd gladly take any message from you!) or to learn more about the developpment team. Finally, the "Help" menu gives you access to this user guide and to an FAQ if you have any question regarding the use of this website.

All these information will be stored in our database and accessible by the other members of our website. The default role you will be attributed is reader, and can be upgraded by any user with a higher status. This means that
								an annotator can pass you from reader to annotator, then a validator can make you validator and finally, you'll be able to get the admin rank if a root user makes you admin.

							  <p class="card-text">The annotate page is a page that's only accessible to annotators or higher ranked users. The goal of this page for the user is to give him the opportunity to annotate genomes thanks to a basic form we implemented.
								In order to do that, the user has to select the ID of the genome he will annotate, and can then input the gene's name, biotype, transcript biotype and symbol. Finally, he can input a brief description (200 caracters) of the gene's information. 
								Once all the information are given, a reviewer will check the annotation before publishing it on the website.<br><br></p>
